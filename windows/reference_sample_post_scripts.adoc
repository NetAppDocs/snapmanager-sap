You can refer the sample scripts and create customized scripts based on your environment to perform mirroring and vaulting. The sample scripts are available at default_install_directory\plugins\backup\create\post.

== Mirror_the_backup.cmd

If you are using Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode, you can use this sample script to mirror the backup. It includes three operations (check, describe, and execute) and executes them at the end of the script. The script also includes error message handling with codes of 0 to 4 and > 4:

REM|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
REM| Pre-requisite/Assumption:                                                                                       |
REM|   SnapMirror relationship for the requested secondary storage volumes must be configured in Secondary storage. |
REM|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
REM
REM
REM This script can be used from the SnapManager graphical user interface (GUI) and command line interface (CLI).
REM
REM To execute the post-task script for the backup operation from SnapManager GUI, follow these steps:
REM  1. From the Backup wizard > Task Specification page > Post-Tasks tab > select the post-task scripts from the Available Scripts section.
REM
REM
REM To execute the post-task script for the backup operation from SnapManager CLI, follow these steps:
REM  1. create a task specification XML file.
REM  2. Add the post-script name in the <post-tasks> tag of the XML file.
REM
REM Example:
REM              <post-tasks>
REM                 <task>
REM                    <name>Mirror the backup</name>
REM                      <description>Mirror the backup</description>
