You can view a summary listing of all the operations performed against a profile.

== About this task

You can view the following information when you list operations associated with a particular profile:

* Start and end date when the operation ran
* Operation status
* Operation ID
* Type of operation
* Host that it ran upon

.Step

. To list the summary information of all the operations, use the following command:
+
`*smsap operation list profile -profile _profile_name_ -delimiter _character_ [-quiet | -verbose]*`
+
When the `-delimiter` option is specified, the command lists each row on a separate line and the attributes in that row are separated by the character specified.
