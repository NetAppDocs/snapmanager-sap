If SnapManager is installed on the host, start the graphical user interface (GUI) for SnapManager by selecting the program from a list of programs.

* Ensure that the SnapManager server is started.

You can start the SnapManager GUI in one of the following ways:

* In the SnapManager host, click *Start* > *All Programs* > *NetApp* > *SnapManager for SAP* > *Start SMSAP GUI*.
* If SnapManager is not installed on the host, use Java Web Start, which downloads SnapManager components and starts the GUI.
