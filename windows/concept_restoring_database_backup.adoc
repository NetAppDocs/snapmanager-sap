SnapManager for SAP enables you to restore a database to the state it was when a Snapshot copy was taken. Because backups are created more frequently, the number of logs that need to be applied is reduced, thus reducing the mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) for a database.

The following are some of the tasks that you can perform related to restoring and recovering data in databases:

* Perform a file-based restore.
* Restore the entire backup or a portion of it.
+
If you restore a portion of it, you specify a group of tablespaces or a group of data files. You can also restore the control files along with the data or just the control files themselves.

* Recover the data based on either a point in time or on all of the available logs, which stores the last transaction committed to the database.
+
The point in time can be an Oracle System Change Number (SCN) or a date and time (yyyy-mm-dd:hh:mm:ss). SnapManager uses the 24-hour clock.

* Restore from backups on primary storage (local backups).
* Restore and recover the backup by using SnapManager, or use SnapManager to restore the backup and use another tool, such as Recovery Manager (RMAN), to recover the data.
* Restore backups from alternate locations.

For more information, see the .

You can restore a backup made by a previous version of SnapManager by using SnapManager 3.0 and later versions.

Administrators can perform restore or recovery operations by using the SnapManager graphical user interface (GUI) or by using the command-line interface (CLI).
