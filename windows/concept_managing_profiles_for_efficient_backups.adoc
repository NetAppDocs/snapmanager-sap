You must create a profile in SnapManager for the database on which you want to perform an operation. You must select the profile and then select the operation that you want to perform.

== Tasks related to profiles

You can perform the following tasks:

* Create profiles to enable full or partial backups and backups to primary or secondary storage.
+
You can also create profiles to separate the archive log backups from the data file backups.

* Verify profiles.
* Update profiles.
* Delete profiles.

== About profiles and authentication

When you create a profile, you can specify a database and choose one of the following methods to connect to the database:

* Oracle authentication with a user name, password, and port
* Operating system (OS) authentication with no user name, password, or port.
+
For OS authentication, you must enter the OS account user and group information.

* Database authentication when sqlnet.authentication_services is set to NONE. SnapManager then uses the database user name and password for all the connections to the target database. SnapManager can also use the Windows native authentication when sqlnet.authentication_services is set to NTS.

You can set sqlnet.authentication_services to NONE only in the following environments:

|===
| Database layout| Oracle version| Is database authentication supported for the target database
a|
Any non-ASM and non-RAC database
a|
Oracle 10g and Oracle 11g (lesser than 11.2.0.3)
a|
Yes
|===
*Note:* After you disable sqlnet.authentication_services and change the authentication method to database authentication, you must set sqlnet.authentication_services to NONE.

If you are accessing a profile for the first time, you must enter your profile password. After you enter your credentials, you can view the database backups within the profile.
