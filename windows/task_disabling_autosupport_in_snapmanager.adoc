You must disable AutoSupport if you do not want the storage system to receive messages from the SnapManager server for every successful backup operation.

By default, AutoSupport is enabled if the configuration file does not contain the auto_support.on parameter. In this scenario, you must add the auto_support.on parameter in the configuration file and set the value to FALSE.

. Stop the SnapManager server.
. In the smsap.config configuration file, set the value of the auto_support.on parameter to FALSE.
+
auto_support.on=FALSE

. Restart the SnapManager server.
