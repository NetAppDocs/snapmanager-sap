You can change properties of a backup so it is eligible or ineligible for deletion according to the retention policy.

When you create a backup, you can set its retention policy. You can later choose to either keep that backup for a longer period than the retention policy allows or specify that you no longer need the backup and want the retention policy to manage it.
