You can verify the Oracle listener status by using the `lsnrctl status` command.

== What you'll need

* You must connect to the database.

== About this task

The listener port details are as follows:

* A standard SAP Oracle installation sets the listener port to 1527.
* Anything that references a managed database listener port should have the value as 1527.
* Anything that references the repository database listener port should have the value as 1521.

The Oracle listener's log is located at ``%ORACLE_HOME%\network\log where ORACLE_HOME is \oracle\SID\oracle version`.
