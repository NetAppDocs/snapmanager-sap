You can use the BRRESTORE or `smsap restore` command to restore a backup that you made with BRBACKUP on a different host. The new host must also be running SnapManager for SAP.

== Make SnapManager profile available

Before you can run BRRESTORE, you must make the SnapManager profile of the original host available to the new host. Complete the following steps:

* Set credential for repository: Use the `smsap credential set` command to enable the new host to access the SnapManager repository used for the original backup.
* Set credential for profile: Use the `smsap credential set` command to enable the new host to access the SnapManager profile used for the original backup.
* Load the profile on the new host: Use the `smsap profile sync` command to load the SnapManager profile information onto the new host.

== Run BRRESTORE

Configure new storage on the new host with the same paths as the original storage on the original host.

Use the `BRRESTORE` command to restore the backup to the new host. By default, the files are restored to the original path locations. You can specify an alternate path for the restored files using the `-m` option of the `BRRESTORE` command. See the SAP documentation for more information on `BRRESTORE`.
