SnapManager enables you to set credentials for database users to access the repository. Using credentials, you can restrict or prevent access to the SnapManager hosts, repositories, profiles, and databases.

If you set credentials by using the credential set command, SnapManager does not prompt you for a password.

You can set user credentials when you install SnapManager or later.

. Enter the following command:
+
`smsap credential set -repository -dbname repo_service_name -host repo_host -login -username repo_username [-password repo_password] -port repo_port`
