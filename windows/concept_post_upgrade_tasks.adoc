After upgrading to a later version of SnapManager, you must update the existing repository. You might also want to modify the backup retention class assigned to the existing backups.

NOTE: After upgrading to SnapManager 3.3 or later, you need to set sqlnet.authentication_services to NONE if you want to use database (DB) authentication as the only authentication method. This feature is not supported for RAC databases.
