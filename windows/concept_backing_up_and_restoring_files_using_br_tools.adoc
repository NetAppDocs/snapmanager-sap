In addition to backing up database files, you can use BR*Tools to back up and restore any files, such as the SAP system files stored on the storage system.

Follow the SAP BR*Tools documentation for the BRBACKUP and BRRESTORE commands. The following additional information applies when you are using SnapManager for SAP:

* The files must be stored on the storage system.
* Be sure you have permissions for the files you are backing up. For example, backing up SAP system files (`BRBACKUP backup_mode=sap_dir`) or Oracle system files (`BRBACKUP backup_mode=ora_dir`) requires root permission on the host. Use the `su root` command before running BRBACKUP.
