SnapManager supports data protection to protect the backups on the secondary or tertiary storage systems. You must set up SnapMirror and SnapVault relationships between the source and the destination volumes.

NOTE: Backups created using BR*Tools cannot be protected using SnapManager for SAP.

You can use the post-backup scripts from both command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) to protect the backups on a primary storage system.
