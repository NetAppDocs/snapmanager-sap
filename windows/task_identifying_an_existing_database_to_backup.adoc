You can identify the system identifier (SID) of the SnapManager database which is used in creating a profile.

The standard Oracle user ID for SAP systems is orasid where sid is a three-character, alphanumeric value, for example, PRD, PR1, DEV, or QA3.

. Click *Start* > *Control Panel* > *Administrative Tools* > *Services*.
. Verify the Oracle service, OracleServiceSID.

If the service is called OracleServiceFASDB, then the database SID is FASDB.
