You must ensure that licenses required for data protection are installed and enabled on the primary and secondary storage systems.

Primary storage systems receive the latest transaction updates for the Oracle database, store the data, and provide local backup protection of the database. The primary storage system also maintains database data files, log files, and control files. Secondary storage systems act as remote storage for the protected backups.

For data protection, the following licenses must be installed and enabled on primary storage systems:

NOTE: If you want to enable data protection on the secondary storage systems, you must also install and enable these licenses on the secondary storage systems.

* Either Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode (7.3.1 or later) or clustered Data ONTAP (8.2 or later)
* SnapVault
* SnapRestore
* SnapMirror
* FlexClone is required for cloning.

FlexClone is also, required for Storage Area Network (SAN) only if SnapDrive is configured to use FlexClone in SAN environments.

* The appropriate protocol, for example, Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI), or Fibre Channel (FC)
