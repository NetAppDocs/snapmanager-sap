SnapManager operates in cluster configurations.

SnapManager supports the same host cluster and  configurations that the SnapDrive product and Host Utilities Kit support.

SnapManager also supports non-clustered configurations where a single host is connected to a single storage system, supported host clusters, and storage systems running Data ONTAP controller failover.
