Instead of a full backup, you can choose to perform a partial backup of the tablespaces in a database. While SnapManager takes a Snapshot copy of volumes for _full_ backups, SnapManager takes a Snapshot copy of each specified tablespace for _partial_ backups.

Because the tablespace level is the lowest level that Oracle allows into backup mode, SnapManager processes backups at the tablespace level, even if you specify a data file in a tablespace.

With a partial backup, each tablespace exists in backup mode for a shorter amount of time compared to a full backup. During an online backup, the database is always available to users; however, the database must perform more work and the host must perform more physical I/O. In addition, because it is taking Snapshot copies of each tablespace specified or each tablespace containing a specified data file instead of the entire volume, SnapManager takes more Snapshot copies.

SnapManager takes Snapshot copies of specific tablespaces or data files. The partial backup algorithm is a loop that SnapManager repeats until it has taken a Snapshot copy of each specified tablespace or data file.

NOTE: Although you can perform a partial backup, it is recommended that you always perform a full backup of the entire database.

During a partial backup, SnapManager performs these actions:

. Places the tablespace containing the data files into backup mode.
. Takes a Snapshot copy of all the volumes used by the tablespace.
. Takes the tablespace out of backup mode.
. Continues this process, until it has taken a Snapshot copy of all the tablespaces or files.
. Forces a log switch and then archives the log files.
. Generates backup control files.
. Takes a Snapshot copy of the log files and the backup control files.
