You must enable AutoSupport, so that storage systems receive messages from the SnapManager server for every successful backup operation.

AutoSupport can be enabled in two ways:

* By default, the new installation of SnapManager does not contain the auto_support.on parameter in the smsap.config configuration file. This implies that autosupport is enabled.
* You can manually configure the auto_support.on parameter.

. Stop the SnapManager server.
. In the smsap.config configuration file, set the value of the auto_support.on parameter to TRUE.
+
auto_support.on=TRUE

. Restart the SnapManager server.
