The AutoSupport feature enables SnapManager server to send AutoSupport messages to the storage system after the backup operation is complete.

NOTE: SnapManager sends AutoSupport messages only for the successful backup operations.

You can enable or disable AutoSupport by assigning the following values to the `auto_support.on` configuration parameter in the `smsap.config` configuration file:

* *TRUE* - Enables AutoSupport
* *FALSE* - Disables AutoSupport

NOTE: By default, AutoSupport is enabled in SnapManager.
