SnapManager can confirm the integrity of the backup using standard Oracle backup verification operations.

Database administrators (DBAs) can perform the verification as part of the backup operation, or at another time. DBAs can set the verify operation to occur during an off-peak time when the load on the host servers is less, or during a scheduled maintenance window.
