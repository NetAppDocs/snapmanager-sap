SnapManager enables you to suspend a backup schedule until the backup schedule is resumed.

You can suspend the active schedules. If you try to suspend the backup schedule that is already suspended, you might encounter error message "Cannot suspend: schedule <schedulename> already in suspend state".

. To suspend the backup schedule temporarily, enter this command: `smsap schedule suspend -profile profile_name-schedule-nameschedulename [-quiet | -verbose]`
