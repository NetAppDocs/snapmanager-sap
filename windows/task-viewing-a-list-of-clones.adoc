You can view a list of clones associated with a particular profile.

The list includes the following information about the clones in a profile:

* The ID for the clone
* Status of the clone operation
* Oracle SID for the clone
* Host on which the clone resides
* Label for the clone

If you specify the -verbose option, the output also shows the comments entered for the clone.

. To display a list of all clones for a profile, enter the following command `smsap clone list -profileprofile_name [-quiet | -verbose]`
