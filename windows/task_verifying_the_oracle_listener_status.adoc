You can verify the Oracle listener status by using the lsnrctl status command.

* You must connect to the database.

The listener port details are as follows:

* A standard SAP Oracle installation sets the listener port to 1527.
* Anything that references a managed database listener port should have the value as 1527.
* Anything that references the repository database listener port should have the value as 1521.

The Oracle listener's log is located at %ORACLE_HOME%\network\log where ORACLE_HOME is \oracle\SID\oracle version.

. At the command prompt, enter the command:``lsnrctl status``
