You must be aware of certain considerations for performing data protection.

* To perform clone or restore operations from secondary systems, you must mount the destination volume in the namespace and export it properly.
* You must disable the SnapDrive configuration parameter check-export-permission-nfs-clone by setting the value to off.
+
The SnapDrive for UNIX documentation on the NetApp Support Site contains additional information about the check-export-permission-nfs-clone parameter.

* You must configure the SnapMirror relationship for the requested secondary storage volumes in the secondary storage system.
* You must configure the SnapVault relationship for the requested secondary storage qtrees in the secondary storage system for Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode.
* You must define a policy and rules for the user-defined SnapMirror label if you are using SnapVault post-script for clustered Data ONTAP.
+
SnapVault post-script supports clustered Data ONTAP volumes and the SnapMirror relation types DP and XDP. The ONTAP documentation on the NetApp Support Site contains information about configuring SnapMirror and SnapVault.
