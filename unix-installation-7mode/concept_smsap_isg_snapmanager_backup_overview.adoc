SnapManager uses NetApp Snapshot technology to create backups of databases. You can use the DBVERIFY utility, or you can use SnapManager to verify the integrity of the backups.

SnapManager backs up a database by creating Snapshot copies of the volumes containing data files, control files, and archive log files. Together, these Snapshot copies comprise a backup set that SnapManager can use to restore a database.
