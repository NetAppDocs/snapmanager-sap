All restore processes are not supported in all SnapManager for SAP versions. After upgrading SnapManager, you need to be aware of the restore process that you can use for restoring a backup.

The backups that are created by using SnapManager 3.0 or later can be restored by using both fast restore and file-based restore processes. However, the backups that are created by using a version earlier than SnapManager 3.0 can be restored by using only the file-based restore process.

You can determine the SnapManager version used to create the backup by running the -backup show command.
