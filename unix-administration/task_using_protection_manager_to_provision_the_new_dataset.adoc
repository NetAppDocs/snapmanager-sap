[.lead]
After the smsap_paydb dataset is created, the storage administrator uses Protection Manager to assign storage system resources to provision the dataset's Backup node.

Before provisioning the newly created dataset, the storage administrator confers with the DBA partner for the name of the dataset specified in the profile.

In this case, the dataset name is smsap_prod01.sample.com_P01.

. Go to Protection Manager's NetApp Management Console.
. From the menu bar, click *Data* > *Datasets* > *Overview*.
+
The Datasets tab of the Datasets window displays a list of datasets that includes the dataset that was just created through SnapManager.

. Locate and select the *smsap_prod01.sample.com_p01* dataset.
+
When you select this dataset, the graph area displays the smsap_p01 dataset with its backup node unprovisioned. Its conformance status is flagged as nonconformant.

. With the smsap_p01 dataset still highlighted, click *Edit*.
+
The Protection Manager's NetApp Management Console displays the Edit Dataset window for the *smsap_prod01.sample.com_p01* dataset. The window's navigation pane displays configuration options for the dataset's primary node, backup connection, and backup node.

. From the navigation pane, locate the options for the dataset's backup node and select *provisioning/resource pools*.
+
The Edit Dataset window displays a setting for default provisioning policy and a list of available resource pools.

. For this example, select the *p01_backup_resource* resource pool and click *>*.
+
The selected resource pool is listed in the "Resource Pools for this node" field.

. Click *Finish* to save your changes.

The Protection Manager automatically provisions the secondary backup node with resources from the paydb_backup_resource resource pool.
