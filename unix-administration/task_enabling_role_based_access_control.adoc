SnapManager role-based access control (RBAC) is enabled using SnapDrive. Upon installation of SnapDrive, RBAC is disabled by default. After you enable RBAC in SnapDrive, SnapManager then performs operations with RBAC enabled.

The snapdrive.config file in SnapDrive sets many options, one of which enables RBAC.

The SnapDrive documentation contains details about SnapDrive.

. Open the snapdrive.conf file in an editor.
. Enable RBAC by changing the value of the rbac-method parameter from native to dfm.
