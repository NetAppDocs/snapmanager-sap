For any storage system volume that uses the NFS protocol and contains SAP data backed up using BR*Tools, you must disable client access to the Snapshot copies of that volume. If client access is enabled, BR*Tools will attempt to create backups of the hidden .snapshot directories that contain previous backups.

To disable client access, use one of the following methods.

* Using Data ONTAP: Using the Data ONTAP command line interface, enter the following command: vol options volume_name nosnapdir on wherein volume_name is the name of the volume containing SAP data, for example, /vol/falls_sap_cer9i_data1
* Using FilerView: To disable access using the FilerView graphical user interface, you must already have a Snapshot copy of the volume.
 .. In the FilerView left pane, select *Volumes* > *Snapshots* > *Manage*.
 .. On the Manage Snapshots page, click the volume name in the Volume column.
 .. On the Configure Snapshots page, clear the Snapshot Directory Visible check box, and click *Apply.*

For more information about disabling client access to Snapshot copies, see the chapter about Snapshot Management of the _Data ONTAP Data Protection Online Backup and Recovery Guide_ for your version of Data ONTAP.
