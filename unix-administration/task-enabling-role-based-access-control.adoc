SnapManager role-based access control (RBAC) is enabled using SnapDrive. Upon installation of SnapDrive, RBAC is disabled by default. After you enable RBAC in SnapDrive, SnapManager then performs operations with RBAC enabled.

*About this task*

The `snapdrive.config` file in SnapDrive sets many options, one of which enables RBAC.

The SnapDrive documentation contains details about SnapDrive.

.Steps

. Open the `snapdrive.conf` file in an editor.
. Enable RBAC by changing the value of the `rbac-method` parameter from `*native*` to `*dfm*`.
+
The default value for this parameter is `*native*`, which disables RBAC.
