You must enable AutoSupport, so that storage systems receive messages from the SnapManager server for every successful backup operation.

*About this task*

AutoSupport can be enabled in two ways:

* By default, the new installation of SnapManager does not contain the `auto_support.on` parameter in the `smsap.config` configuration file. This implies that autosupport is enabled.
* You can manually configure the `auto_support.on` parameter.

.Steps

. Stop the SnapManager server.
. In the `smsap.config` configuration file, set the value of the `auto_support.on` parameter to `*TRUE*`.
+
*Example*
+
auto_support.on=TRUE

. Restart the SnapManager server.
