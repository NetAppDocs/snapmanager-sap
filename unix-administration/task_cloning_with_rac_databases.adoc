. To clone your RAC database, enter the following command: `smsap clone create -backup-label backup_label-profile profile_name-newsid new_SID-clonespec full_path_to_clonespec_file-verbose`
. To change the cloned non-RAC database to a RAC database, rename the file from initclone_SID.ora to initclone_local_instance_SID.ora.
. Edit the renamed file to set the parameter cluster.database to true. RAC database information.
