Before you restore from an alternate location, you need to restore the necessary files from any storage media and restore the files from applications like SnapVault or SnapMirror to a file system mounted on the local host.

You can use the restore from an alternate location operation to copy the files from an alternate file system to an active file system.

You need to specify the alternate locations from which to restore the original files by creating a restore specification.
