Administrators have the option to resume the suspended backup schedule.

If you try to resume the active schedules, you might encounter the error message: "Cannot resume: schedule <schedulename> already in resume state".

. To resume the suspended backup schedule, enter this command: `smsap schedule resume -profile profile_name-schedule-nameschedulename [-quiet | -verbose]`
