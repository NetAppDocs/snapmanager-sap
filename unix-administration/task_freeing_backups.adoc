You can free backups, which deletes the Snapshot copies without deleting the backup metadata. This function frees the space occupied by the backup. You can use the smsap backup free command to free the backups.

*What you'll need*

For a backup to be eligible for freeing, you must ensure the following:

* Backup was successful
* Backup is not to be mounted
* Backup does not have clones
* Backup is not to be retained by using an unlimited retention policy
* Backup is not already freed

*About this task*

If protection is enabled on the profile and the protection policy contains connections from the primary node that use a mirror relationship, then Snapshot copies are deleted on the primary node when a backup is freed. Those Snapshot copies are also deleted from the mirror nodes when the next transfer to secondary storage occurs.

When you free a protected backup, SnapManager requests that Protection Manager remove the local Snapshot copies for the backup. If the backup free operation is successful for the protected backups, the Snapshot copies are deleted by Protection Manager in an asynchronous manner.
