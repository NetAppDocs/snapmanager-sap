SnapManager provides the flexibility to restore full databases, specific tablespaces, files, control files, or a combination of these entities. SnapManager enables you to restore data by using a file-based restore processor a faster, volume-based restore process. Database administrators can select the process they want to use or let SnapManager decide which process is appropriate.

SnapManager enables database administrators (DBAs) to preview restore operations. The preview feature enables DBAs to view each restore operation on a file-by-file basis.

DBAs can specify the level to which SnapManager restores and recovers information when performing restore operations. For example, DBAs can restore and recover data to specific points in time. The restore point can be a date and time or an Oracle System Change Number (SCN).

SnapManager (3.2 or later) enables you to restore and recover database backups automatically without DBA intervention. You can use SnapManager to create archive log backups, and then use those archive log backups to restore and recover the database backups. Even if the backup's archive log files are managed in an external archive log location, you can specify that external location so those archive logs can help recover the restored database.
