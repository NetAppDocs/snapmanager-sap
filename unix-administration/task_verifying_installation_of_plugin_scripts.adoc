SnapManager enables you to install and use custom scripts to perform various operations. SnapManager provides plugins for the backup, restore, and clone operations, which you can use to automate your custom scripts before and after the backup, restore, and clone operations.

. Enter the following command:
+
`*smsap plugin check -osaccount _os db user name_*`

+
